- Spanish
- French
- German
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Chinese
- Japanese
- Korean
- Arabic

### Translation Technology

The translation service is powered by Hugging Face's Helsinki-NLP models, specifically:

- `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-*` series for English to other languages
- Each model is specifically trained for its language pair
- High-quality neural machine translation
- Support for technical and domain-specific terminology

### Usage

To use the translation feature:

1. Set up your Hugging Face API key in the `.env` file:
```env
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. The translation service is automatically integrated with:
   - Ticket summaries
   - Communication templates
   - User interface elements

3. API Endpoints:
   - `GET /api/translation/languages` - Get list of supported languages
   - `POST /api/translation/translate` - Translate text to target language

### Example API Usage

```javascript
// Get supported languages
const response = await fetch('/api/translation/languages');
const languages = await response.json();

// Translate text
const translation = await fetch('/api/translation/translate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: 'Your text to translate',
    targetLanguage: 'es' // Language code
  })
});
```

## Face Verification System

The portal includes a secure face verification system for password resets and user authentication:

### Technical Implementation
- **Face Detection**: Uses face-api.js with Tiny Face Detector model
- **Face Recognition**: Implements face-api.js Face Recognition model
- **Face Landmarks**: Utilizes 68-point facial landmark detection
- **Model Files Required**:
  - `tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json`
  - `tiny_face_detector_model-shard1`
  - `face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json`
  - `face_landmark_68_model-shard1`
  - `face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json`
  - `face_recognition_model-shard1`
  - `face_recognition_model-shard2`

### Local Setup Requirements

1. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
# Install required packages
npm install face-api.js canvas
```

2. **Download Models**:
```bash
# Run the model download script
cd server
node scripts/downloadModels.js
```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
Add the following to your `.env` file:
```env
# Face Verification Settings
FACE_VERIFICATION_THRESHOLD=0.6  # Lower value = stricter matching
FACE_DETECTION_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.3  # Minimum confidence for face detection
```

4. **Directory Structure**:
Ensure the following directories exist:
```
server/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/           # Face detection models
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ faces/       # User face images
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ downloadModels.js
```
